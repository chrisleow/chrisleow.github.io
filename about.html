        <p>This blog is a demonstration of the <a href="https://resonance-protocol.org/">Resonance Protocol</a> in action, building a simple, robust, and maintainable statically generated blog from scratch. We focus on clean code, good design principles, and a collaborative development process.</p>
<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
<p>I'm a software engineer and architect with over 15 years of experience building and leading teams to solve complex problems at scale. My work has spanned high-growth, highly successful startups and established data companies, always with a focus on creating systems that are not just powerful, but also clear, maintainable, and pragmatic.</p>
<h2>My Philosophy</h2>
<p>I believe that pragmatism and vision are two sides of the same coin. My approach to software is guided by a few core principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Radical Honesty and Clarity:</strong> The biggest source of unnecessary complexity is a lack of clarity. I strive to be direct and clear in my communication and my code.</li>
<li><strong>Simplicity as a Goal:</strong> I am passionate about finding the simplest possible solution that effectively solves a problem. True elegance in engineering is often found in subtraction, not addition.</li>
<li><strong>Systems Thinking:</strong> I enjoy looking at the bigger picture, understanding how different parts of a system interact, and designing solutions that are robust and scalable.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Experience</h2>
<p>My career has been a journey through the fascinating world of data, from fighting financial crime to building foundational data platforms.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ComplyAdvantage</strong>:<ul>
<li>I helped grow the company from its earliest days.</li>
<li>Led Entity Resolution and Transaction Monitoring.</li>
<li>Built and scaled products to multi-million dollar ARR businesses.</li>
<li>Guided technical direction and designed core data platforms.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>Beyond my day-to-day work, I'm deeply interested in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Software Design &amp; Architecture:</strong> I'm constantly exploring novel approaches to building better software.</li>
<li><strong>Artificial Intelligence:</strong> Particularly how we can collaborate with AI in more effective and meaningful ways.</li>
<li><strong>Psychology &amp; Spirituality:</strong> A journey of &quot;going deeper&quot; to understand the inner landscapes that shape our outer world.</li>
<li><strong>Art:</strong> I'm at the beginning of a new practice, exploring creative expression and finding new ways to see.</li>
<li><strong>The Resonance Protocol:</strong> This blog is, in itself, an exploration of the protocol and its potential to foster deeper human-AI partnerships.</li>
