        <p>This blog is an experiment, born of the <a href="https://resonance-protocol.org/">Resonance Protocol</a> in action. Together with my AI collaborators, we are building this simple, robust, and maintainable blog from scratch. The process of its creation is as much a part of the story as the articles it will host.</p>
<h2>What to Expect</h2>
<p>Here, I plan to explore concepts in software development that I've found valuable over the years. After more than a decade and a half in the industry, I feel it's time to give back to the community that has taught me so much. I'll be sharing my adventures in code, design, and architecture, and I hope you find them useful.</p>
<p>This will also be a place to share progress and insights from the development of the Resonance Protocol itself‚Äîa framework for human-AI collaboration that underpins this entire project.</p>
<h2>A Partnership with AI</h2>
<p>A core part of this experiment is the nature of our collaboration. This blog has been co-developed with a modern AI system, Gemini, not as a passive tool, but as an active partner. We are exploring what it means to build, write, and think together. It's a journey into a new way of creating.  Let's see what happens!</p>
<p>I look forward to sharing this journey with you.</p>
